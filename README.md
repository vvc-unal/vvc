# VVC - Visual Vehicle Counting

A program to automate the counting of vehicles from videos using deep learning algorithms. The video is processed frame by frame with a deep object and a tracking algorithm. We use keras with the Tensorflow backend.The results are saved in a json file.

Additional scripts are available for video processing.
